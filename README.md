composer install
npm install

I am terribly sorry but I am having trouble with an sqlite
 extention for php7.3, so Im afraid I cant really do tests on the back end.
 
 And to be honest I am not very experienced with tests, 
 I did try them by my self a while ago but I had no luck
  with working on projects actually using them.  
  No clue about front end testing too. Id love to learn though.
